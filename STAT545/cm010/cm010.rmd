install.packages("nycflights13")
```

```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(nycflights13))
```

## Types of mutating join

### Let's join tibbles using four mutating functions:  `left_join`, `right_join`, `inner_join` and `full_join`.

- create two tibbles named `a` and `b`, similar to Data Wrangling Cheatsheet
- use `left_join`, `right_join`, `inner_join` and `full_join` functions
- example for `left_join`: Join matching rows from b to a
- example for `right_join`: Join matching rows from a to b
- example for `inner_join`: Join data. Retain only rows in both sets
- example for `full_join`: Join data. Retain all values, all rows
- example of using two different variables from two datasets
- example of two variables have identical names 

### create two tibbles named `a` and `b`

```{r}
(a <- tibble(x1 = LETTERS[1:3], x2 = 1:3))
(b <- tibble(x1 = LETTERS[c(1,2,4)], x3 = c("T", "F", "T")))
```

### left_join: Join matching rows from `b` to `a` by matching "x1" variable

```{r}
left_join(a, b, by = "x1")
```

### right_join: Join matching rows from `a` to `b` by matching "x1" variable.

```{r}
right_join(a, b, by = "x1")
```

### inner_join: Join data. Retain only rows in both sets `a` to `b` by matching "x1" variable.

```{r}
inner_join(a, b, by = "x1") ##only match with value both have
```

### full_join: Join data. Retain all values, all rows of `a` to `b` by matching "x1"

```{r}
full_join(a, b, by = "x1")
```

### what happen if we do not specify `by` option?

```{r}
left_join(a, b) #default by: join by = "x1"
```

### what happen if we specify two different variables from two tibbles `a` to `b`?

```{r}
left_join(a, b, by = c("x1" = "x3"))
b
a
```

### what happen if two columns of `a` and `c` datasets have the identical names?

```{r}
# make data frame c and use inner_join()
(c <- tibble(x1 = c(LETTERS[1:2],"x"), x2 = c(1,4,5)))
left_join(a, c)
```

## In class practice

`nycflights13` dataset has four tibbles e.g., `flights`, `airports`, `planes` and `weather`.

### Explore and subset data:

- Explore `nycflights13` dataset
- to reduce the running time, subset `flights` data.frame taking first 1000 rows and year, tailnum, carrier, time_hour columns.

### Practice Exercises:
- check which variables are common in `weather` and `flights2` datasets
- add `weather` information to the `flights2` dataset by matching "year" and "time_hour" variables.
-add `weather` information to the `flights2` dataset by matching only "time_hour" variable.

### 1. Explore `nycflights13` dataset

```{r}
#check the tibbles included in `nycflights13` package
class(flights)
dim(flights)
colnames(flights)
colnames(airports)
colnames(planes)
colnames(weather)
```

### 2. Drop unimportant variables so it's easier to understand the join results. Also take first 1000 rows to run it faster.

```{r}
flights2 <- flights[1:1000,] %>% 
  select(year, tailnum, carrier, time_hour)

dim(flights2)
```

### 3. Add airline names to `flights2` from `airlines` dataset.

```{r}
# Which join function to use?
colnames(airlines)
colnames(flights2)
left_join(airlines, flights2)
```

### 4. Add weather information to the `flights2` dataset by matching "year" and "time_hour" variables.

```{r}
# add weather information to the flights2 dataset by matching "year" and "time_hour"
colnames(weather) 
  flights2 %>% 
  left_join(weather, by = c("year", "time_hour"))
```

## Types of filtering join

###Let's filter tibbles using two filtering functions:

- create two tibbles named `a` and `b`, similar to Data Wrangling Cheatsheet
- use `semi_join`, `anti_join` functions
- example for `semi_join`: All rows in a that have a match in b
- example for `anti_join`: All rows in a that do not have a match in b
- example of using two different variables from two datasets


### example for `semi_join`: All rows in `a` that have a match in `b`

```{r}
semi_join(a,b)
a
b
```

# example for `anti_join`: All rows in `a` that do not have a match in `b`

```{r}
anti_join(a,b)
```

# example of joinin by matching two variables from both datasets `a` and `c`

```{r}
a
c
semi_join(a, c, by = c("x1", "x2"))
```

## Types of Set Operations for two datasets

###Let's use three `set` functions:

- create two tibbles named `y` and `z`, similar to Data Wrangling Cheatsheet
- use `intersect`, `union` and `setdiff` functions
- example for `intersect`: Rows that appear in both `y` and `z`
- example for `union`: Rows that appear in either or both `y` and `z`
- example for `setdiff`: Rows that appear in `y` but not `z`. __Caution:__ `setdiff` for `y` to `z` and `z` to `y` are different.
- what happen if colnames are different? 

### create two tibbles named `y` and `z`, similar to Data Wrangling Cheatsheet

```{r}
(y <-  tibble(x1 = LETTERS[1:3], x2 = 1:3))
(z <- tibble(x1 = c("B", "C", "D"), x2 = 2:4))
```

### example for `intersect`: Rows that appear in both `y` and `z`

```{r}
intersect(y,z)
```

### example for `union`: Rows that appear in either or both `y` and `z`

```{r}
union(y,z)
```

# example for `setdiff`: Rows that appear in `y` but not `z`. __Caution:__ `setdiff` for `y` to `z` and `z` to `y` are different.

```{r}
setdiff(y,z)

setdiff(z,y)
```

# what happen if colnames are differentin `y` and `x`? Is there any error message and why?

```{r}
(x <- tibble(x1 = c("B", "C", "D"), x3 = 2:4))
#intersect(y,x)
#intersect(y,x)
```

## Types of binding datasets

###Let's bind datasets by rows or column using two binding functions:

- create two tibbles named `y` and `z`, similar to Data Wrangling Cheatsheet
- use `bind_rows`, `bind_cols` functions
- example for `bind_rows`: Append z to y as new rows
- example for `bind_cols`: Append z to y as new columns. __Caution__: matches rows by position
- what happen if colnames are different? 


### example for `bind_rows`: Append z to y as new rows

```{r}
bind_rows(y,z)
```

### example for `bind_cols`: Append z to y as new columns. __Caution__: matches rows by position

```{r}
bind_cols(y,z) #check colnames
bind_cols(z,y)
```

### what happen if colnames are different? 

```{r}
(x <- tibble(x1 = c("B", "C", "D"), x3 = 2:4))
bind_rows(y,x)
bind_cols(y,x)
```


##Practice Exercises
Practice these concepts in the following exercises. It might help you to first identify the type of function you are applying.


### 1. Filter the rows of `flights2` by matching "year" and "time_hour" variables to `weather` dataset. Use both `semi_join()` and `anti_join()`

```{r}
semi_join(flights2, weather, by = c("year", "time_hour"))
  
anti_join(flights2, weather, by = c("year", "time_hour"))
```


### 2. Can we apply `set` and `binding` funcions between `flights2` and `weather` datasets. Why and why not?
```{r}
#union(flights2, weather)
bind_rows(flights2, weather)
#bind_cols(flights2, weather)
flights2
weather
```


### 3. Let's create a tibble `p` with "x1" and "x2" coulmns and have duplicated element in "x1" column. Create another tibble `q` with "x1" and "x3" columns. Then apply `left_join` function `p` to `q` and `q` to `p`. 
```{r}
(p <- tibble(x1 = c("a", "b", "b", "c"), x2 = 1:4))
(q <- tibble(x1 = c("a", "b", "c", "c"), x3 = 5:8))

left_join(p,q)
left_join(q,p)
```
